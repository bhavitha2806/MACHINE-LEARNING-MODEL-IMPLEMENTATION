DESCRIPTION:

Task 4 focuses on implementing a machine learning model using Scikit-learn to classify or predict outcomes from a dataset. In this project, a simple spam detection system is developed using a Naive Bayes classifier to determine whether a given message is spam or not. The implementation is done entirely within a Jupyter Notebook to ensure transparency and interactivity. The dataset used contains sample messages labeled as spam or not spam, which are preprocessed using CountVectorizer to convert the text into numerical features. The model is then trained, tested, and evaluated using standard techniques such as train-test splitting, accuracy measurement, and confusion matrix analysis. The output includes model predictions for new inputs and performance metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. This task demonstrates essential steps in building a predictive model: data preparation, training, evaluation, and inference. The deliverables include a Jupyter Notebook containing all code, results, and explanations, showcasing both the technical implementation and understanding of machine learning workflows. This hands-on exercise is valuable for gaining practical experience in supervised learning, particularly in text classification tasks.
